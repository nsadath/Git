Git and Github:
Git is a distributed version control system
Approach 1 : Git is a local tool which we install to manage the code locally
1.Multiple files here what happens is lot of files and hard to maintain in real projects it would be very cubersome
2.Single file well u can have single file but u will lose all the previous files in case if u want to switch to earlier file
3. Version Management : Hence in version control this is solved u will still have one copy but u can always switch to any other previous version when needed

Git is al about control and tracking of code changes over time
1. Version control system
2. Manage code history
3. Track Changes

Github: is a tool
1. Largest development platform
2. cloud hosting & collaboration provider
3. Git Repository hosting

they both work together but they are however separate.

Mac User : Z shell basics
Windows User : Comand prompt basics

CMD Line : 
GUI: User Friendly and Easy to explore
Command Prompt : text based interaction; Time Saving and more possibilities such as (Start of servers,Download and install tools, run code, execute files, and now 
here more imp is working with Git)


Mac terminalogy :
Terminal (its a text input environment (hardware) its just a hardware and not the software) so we have a software for it so called shell
Shell is a text input interface(software) which brings your computer to life. in mac we have two shell first and the older one is Bash ad 
latest one is Z-Shell

Windows: Command Prompt(cmd) ad Initial Windows Shell (in windows we dont have any differentiation as before if we open cmd then we open the shell too)
Poweshell which was released with Windows 7 however the purpose of it and cmd is completely different with the concept and command being used in it
GitBAsh : is a bash emulation for windows so if u install git in windows u can also install bash here however the cmd u use here and in mac bash remains same

Mac Terminal Basics : pwd : print working directory

/ means we are in the root directory

ls > stands for list items to show items in our current directory

~ > just indicates that we are in home directory 

diretory levels > root > users> home > nadiyasadath@MMDC02FM07DMD6R ~ % cd ~ // here we are in home directory
