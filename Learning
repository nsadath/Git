Git and Github:
Git is a distributed version control system
Approach 1 : Git is a local tool which we install to manage the code locally
1.Multiple files here what happens is lot of files and hard to maintain in real projects it would be very cubersome
2.Single file well u can have single file but u will lose all the previous files in case if u want to switch to earlier file
3. Version Management : Hence in version control this is solved u will still have one copy but u can always switch to any other previous version when needed

Git is al about control and tracking of code changes over time
1. Version control system
2. Manage code history
3. Track Changes

Github: is a tool
1. Largest development platform
2. cloud hosting & collaboration provider
3. Git Repository hosting

they both work together but they are however separate.
